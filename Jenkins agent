How to connect one VM1 to another VM2.

Step1:-
1: Generate SSH Keys on Jenkins VM
            Open terminal on your Jenkins VM.


2: Navigate to the .ssh directory:
              cd ~/.ssh


3: Generate the SSH key pair:
              ssh-keygen
	
4.  After running the command, you will get two files:
              id_rsa → Private Key
              id_rsa.pub → Public Key



Step 2: 
        Add Public Key to Agent VM

1. Log in to the Agent VM.


2. Go to the .ssh directory (create if it doesn't exist):
              cd ~/.ssh

3. Add the public key (id_rsa.pub from Jenkins VM) to the authorized_keys file:
              nano authorized_keys

4.  Paste the contents of id_rsa.pub into the file and save.


Step 3: 
      Create a New Node in Jenkins

Open your Jenkins dashboard.

Go to: Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes and Clouds > New Node
Enter a name for the node and select Permanent Agent.

Configure the following:
      Remote root directory (e.g., /home/jenkins)
      Usage: Use this node as much as possible
      Launch method: Launch agents via SSH
      Host: IP address or hostname of Agent VM
      Credentials: Add credentials
              Kind: SSH Username with private key
              Username: (e.g., jenkins)
              Private Key: Enter the private key (id_rsa content from Jenkins VM)


Click Save and then Launch Agent.








Example Pipeline:-

pipeline {
    agent { label  "vinod"}

    stages {
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
         stage('Create the folder') {
            steps {
                sh 'mkdir -p devops'
            }
        }
    }
